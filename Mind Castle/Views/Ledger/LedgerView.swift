 Ledger is a note generating interface designed to allow
 a user the ability to quickly "capture" notes, pictures,
 drawings, audio... into a node. The ledger supports parsing
 of a shorthand and GUI note generation options.
 It is arguably the more "Hardcore" side of mind castle:
 Think VIM eMACs for notes, with macros, auto view constructors, etc.
